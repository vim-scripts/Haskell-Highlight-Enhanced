This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3175

Mainly based on the plugin (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2062) which is no longer maintained,
the last version is 1.2, so I get started from 1.3.
Thx to it !

That one regards 'class' and 'datatype' as the same, but this one separates them.
That one only highlights the func & class & datatype in the standard Prelude, but this one includes all the official.

Here's the SNAPSHOT

U could see that 'datatype' and 'keyword' are in green, while 'class' in black, function in purple.

Enjoy
